        "\n",
        "   The project encompasses phases such as data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and validation. By employing machine learning algorithms and evaluating model performance, the project seeks to generate actionable recommendations for smartphone selection, which will be documented and shared with stakeholders."
